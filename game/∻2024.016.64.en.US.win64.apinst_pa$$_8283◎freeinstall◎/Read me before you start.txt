 Turning off Antivirus Protection:
                        _______________________________________
 Before downloading and installing on your computer, it’s essential to turn off your antivirus software first. 
 Otherwise, you won’t even be able to download the file from our download zone. 
 Most  virus guards are detecting both app and our website URL, and our team is continually releasing updates to fix this issue. 
 The tool itself identified as a Win32.HackTool and website is detected  as “Potentially Unwanted Content.”
 
 Here are the steps to temporarily disable the protection of most antivirus software.

 ESET: Right-click the Eset icon on the taskbar and choose “Pause Protection.” 
 Select the time you need to turn off the protection, and you’ll be asked to confirm your change twice.
 After that, you can  continue with the download.

 Kaspersky: To install, go to Settings > Additional and turn off the “Self Defence” option.
 You’ll be asked to confirm your change, and you’re ready to go!

 BitDefender: In the main window, select the “Protection” tab and click “View Features.” 
 You need to turn off both self-defense and web firewall.

 Avast: Double click the taskbar icon to open the main control center of the Avast.
 Go to the “Protection” tab and disable both File Shield and Behaviour Sheid.
 Now you’ll be able to install without any problems.
